# Configler
A Configuration Management Library

Inspired by [smallrye-config](https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-config/tree/main) configler
would like to bring support for several configuration management concepts that seem to be lacking
in programming languages other than Java. These concepts include:

- Profiles
- Customizable Config Sources
- Expressions
- Ordinal Sources
- Observability
- Environment Variables & System Properties
- Secret Handling

And above all we want to expose this functionality in a language agnostic way so that it can be ported
over to several different programming languages such as python, golang, rust, c, and even java.

## Project Status
I incepted this ideas as of Oct 24, 2024 so this project is still just an idea. Since I'm personally new to rust and FFIs I will be putting together a rough poc of how that could work first before really
diving into the constructs that we will need to support this project.
